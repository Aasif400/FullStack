Here I performed Frontend (NextJS or ReactJS): The frontend should be built using either React.js or Next.js and should include the following:

1. Homepage: A landing page that contains an input bar where users can insert their usernames. Upon submission, the user should be taken to the Form Page.

2. Form Page: This page should have a form with inputs for the user's phone number, email, name, and date of birth. The form should have two buttons: "Submit" and "Cancel". If the user has previously submitted 
information, the form fields should be pre-filled with the existing data. o Clicking "Submit" should save the form data and navigate the user to the Result Page. o Clicking "Cancel" should discard any changes and return the user to the Homepage.

3. Result Page: This page should display a congratulatory message upon successful form submission. It could also include a button to return to the Homepage. Backend (NestJS): The backend should be built using Nest.js and should include the following:

4.API Endpoints: Create the necessary RESTful API endpoints for the following operations: o Submitting a new form o Retrieving a previously submitted form based on the username o Updating an existing form

5. Database Connection: Implement a database connection for storing form submissions. This could be MongoDB database
